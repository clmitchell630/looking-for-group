            <p> Looking for Group is designed to help bring gamers together who don't typically have friends to play with online.
                <br />
                Currently, trying to find groups of new people to play with online can be a challenge.
                <br />
                We aim to extend that period with the hopes of creating long lasting friendships with people you enjoy gaming with.
                <br />
                We aim to put all of this into a centralized location so that we are the one stop shop for finding others to play with.
