# **__What Problem Does The Application Solve?__**  

1. Finding new people to play games with.
2. Expanding user gameplay and experience.
3. An app that is easy to use.


# **__What Is The App Doing And Why?__**

We are creating an app for individuals who enjoy playing video games and are looking for
other’s who share the same enjoyment. Our app, “Looking for Group”, is intended to match up
individuals with one another and create friendships through video games.
Depending on a person's playstyle, some prefer a solo gaming experience, while others enjoy a
shared gaming experience with other players. This app seeks to make it easier for gamers to group up
together and facilitate the shared experience.
Currently, trying to find groups of new people to play with can be a challenge. Most multiplayer
games have their own method to find another player for you; however, it is often for short term
sessions to accomplish a goal and when you've completed it, it's gg and goodbye. We aim to extend that
period with the hopes of creating long lasting friendships with people you enjoy gaming with.
We aim to put all of this into a centralized location so that we are the one stop shop for finding
others to play with.
